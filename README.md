## Result and Insights :
- I have noticed that the Revenue is continuously growing.
- The busiest days are Mondays, Thursdays and Fridays in general. This does make sense since people do like to visit coffee shops when they are all jacked up for work.
- The busiest hours are in the mornings when people are visiting their offices.
- This trend is similar for all the stores.
- The top category is coffee and the product is Barista Espresso across the board.

## Data Story :
I have noticed that the bottom products for all the stores include some flavours and other products like coffee beans. Also, the merchandise clothing for Hell's Kitchen is way less as compared to other stores. We shall provide some discount offers to this store to increase sales. Or else completely remove it from displaying at this store and keep it available on order only. This shall help us reduce costs of operations.
